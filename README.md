🌸 Iris Dataset - Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
This project performs a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the popular Iris flower dataset using both static and interactive visualizations with Python libraries including Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Plotly.

📊 EDA Components
1. 📌 Summary Statistics
Displays count, mean, std, min, 25%, 50%, 75%, and max for all numeric features.

Helps understand central tendency and spread of data.

2. 📦 Boxplots
Visualizes spread and outliers in each feature (sepal/petal length and width).

Saved as boxplot.png.

3. 📉 Histograms
Shows distribution of individual features.

Useful for detecting skewness and modality.

Saved as histograms.png.

4. 🔗 Pairplot (Seaborn)
Pairwise scatter plots colored by species.

Good for visualizing relationships between features.

5. 🧠 Correlation Matrix
Displays Pearson correlation coefficients.

Heatmap with values and color-coded strength of correlation.

6. 🌐 Interactive Scatter Matrix (Plotly)
Interactive matrix plot where each point is color-coded by species.

Hover for exact values.

Saved as interactive_scatter_matrix.html.

⚙️ How to Run?
